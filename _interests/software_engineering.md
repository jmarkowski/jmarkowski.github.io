I fell in love with programming when I was about 11 years old. My first program
(besides the obligatory *hello world*) was a kind of choose-your-own-adventure
game written in QBasic.

Over the years, my career has meandered in various fields ranging from
electrical engineering, photonics, electro-optical engineering, and finally
back towards the satisfying world software.

Anyone who's a software engineer realizes that the field itself is quite broad.
I've had a hobbyist level of interest in web technologies, and circumstances in
my career have led deep into the embedded world.

A highlight of some of the programming languages and technologies I've worked
with:

* C
* C++
* Docker
* Java
* LaTeX
* MATLAB
* Python
* bash
* Web Technologies: HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, Flask, Web Servers, etc.
* Operating Systems: ThreadX, Embedded Linux

In the end, it doesn't matter what language you code in. The basic constructs in
each language are fundamentally similar. After years of experience, you start
recognizing the patterns in the art of programming itself, and realizing that
effectively architecting a system is significantly more important than being
able to perform any syntactical tricks.
